## 🛠️ Development

### Local Setup

1. **Clone and Install**
   ```bash
   git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
   cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Create .env.local in project root
   cp .env.local.example .env.local  # If example exists
   
   # Add these variables to .env.local:
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
   SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
   TAVILY_API_KEY=your-tavily-api-key
   ```

3. **Start Development**
   ```bash
   # Start frontend
   npm run dev
   
   # Start Supabase (if using local development)
   npm run supabase:start
   
   # Start functions with proper environment loading
   npm run functions:serve
   ```

4. **Open Browser**
   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

### 🚨 Important: Function Environment Setup

**Critical**: Always use `npm run functions:serve` instead of `supabase functions serve` directly. 

The npm script includes the `--env-file .env.local` flag that loads your API keys. Without this, you'll get placeholder content instead of real AI research.

**Signs of missing environment variables:**
- Seeing "Research in progress" instead of real company data
- No entries in `tavily_searches` table
- Function logs show "🚨 TAVILY_API_KEY missing!"

**Troubleshooting:**
```bash
# Check if functions are getting environment variables
npm run functions:serve-debug

# Verify environment file exists
ls -la .env.local

# Check Supabase status
npm run supabase:status
```

### Database Setup

The project uses Supabase with the following main tables:
- `profiles` - User profile information with auto-creation triggers
- `searches` - Research queries with status tracking (pending/processing/completed/failed)
- `interview_stages` - Structured interview process stages with ordering
- `interview_questions` - Questions for each stage with relationships
- `resumes` - CV content storage with intelligent parsing metadata
- `practice_sessions` - User practice tracking with answer persistence
- `practice_answers` - Individual answer records with timing data

All tables include comprehensive Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data protection and user isolation.

### AI Integration - Microservices Architecture

The app uses a sophisticated microservices architecture with four specialized Edge Functions:

**Microservices Design:**
- **cv-analysis:** Independent CV parsing and skill extraction
- **company-research:** Tavily-powered company interview research  
- **job-analysis:** Job description URL extraction and analysis
- **interview-research:** Synthesis orchestrator that generates final outputs

**OpenAI Integration:**
- **Models:** GPT-4o for research synthesis, GPT-4o-mini for CV analysis
- **Structured Output:** Enforced JSON responses with comprehensive error handling
- **Features:** Company insights, personalized guidance, preparation timelines

**Tavily Expert Integration:**
- **Real-Time Research:** Multi-source company interview data
- **Job Analysis:** Advanced extraction from role description URLs
- **Trusted Sources:** Glassdoor, Levels.fyi, Blind, LinkedIn, Indeed
- **Advanced Search:** Parallel targeted queries for comprehensive coverage

**System Features:**
- **Single Responsibility:** Each function has one clear purpose
- **Error Isolation:** Component failures don't cascade
- **Parallel Processing:** Data gathering runs concurrently
- **Graceful Degradation:** Robust fallbacks for all external services
- **Performance Optimized:** Parallel processing and efficient API usage
- **Security:** All API keys securely stored in Supabase secrets

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Basic Company Research
```
Company: Meta
Role: Software Engineer
Country: United States
Target Level: Auto-detect (or select Junior/Mid/Senior)
```

### Advanced Research with Context
```
Company: Stripe
Role: Senior Frontend Engineer
Country: Ireland
Target Level: Senior (override auto-detection)
Role Links: 
- https://stripe.com/jobs/listing/senior-frontend-engineer
- https://careers.stripe.com/jobs/12345

CV: [Upload your resume for personalized insights]
```

### Using Seniority Levels
```
Profile Settings:
- Set your current experience level (Junior/Mid/Senior)
- Questions adapt to your background

Per-Search Override:
- Applying for senior role as mid-level? Select "Senior" in search
- Questions will match the target level, not your current level
```

### Practice Session
1. Complete a company research first
2. Select specific interview stages from Dashboard
3. Navigate to Practice mode with selected questions
4. Use flash-card interface to review questions
5. Time your responses and save answers
6. Track progress across multiple sessions

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

- **Data Encryption:** All user data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Access Control:** Row Level Security ensures user data isolation
- **Privacy First:** No data sharing with third parties
- **User Control:** Full data export and deletion capabilities

## 🚀 Development Approaches

You have **two ways** to develop this app:

### 🌟 **Option 1: Remote-Only Development (Recommended)**
- ✅ Frontend → Remote Supabase (already configured)
- ✅ Functions → Deploy to Remote Supabase Edge Functions  
- ✅ Database → Remote Supabase Database
- ❌ **No `.env.local` needed**
- ❌ **No `supabase start` needed**

### ⚙️ **Option 2: Local Development** 
- ✅ Frontend → Remote Supabase
- ✅ Functions → Run locally for testing
- ✅ Database → Local Supabase
- ⚠️ **Requires `.env.local` for local function testing**

---

## 🌟 **Remote-Only Setup (Recommended)**

### 1. **Configure Environment Variables in Supabase Dashboard**
   ```
   Go to: Supabase Dashboard → Project Settings → Edge Functions → Environment Variables
   
   Add these secrets:
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
   TAVILY_API_KEY=your-tavily-api-key
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
   ```

### 2. **Deploy Functions to Remote**
   ```bash
   # Deploy all functions to remote Supabase
   npm run functions:deploy
   
   # Or deploy a single function
   supabase functions deploy company-research
   ```

### 3. **Start Frontend Development**
   ```bash
   # Only need to run this - connects to remote everything
   npm run dev
   ```

### 4. **Push Database Changes**
   ```bash
   # Push schema changes to remote database  
   npm run db:push
   ```

**✅ Benefits:**
- No local setup complexity
- Real production environment
- No `.env.local` needed
- Faster development cycle

---

## ⚙️ **Local Development Setup**

Only use this if you need to test function changes locally before deploying.

### 1. **Create .env.local (Required for local functions)**
   ```bash
   # Create .env.local in project root
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
   SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
   TAVILY_API_KEY=your-tavily-api-key
   ```

### 2. **Start Local Services**
   ```bash
   # Start frontend
   npm run dev
   
   # Start local Supabase (optional)
   npm run supabase:start
   
   # Start functions locally with environment loading
   npm run functions:serve
   ```

**⚠️ Only needed when:**
- Testing function changes before deployment
- Debugging function logic locally
- Working offline
