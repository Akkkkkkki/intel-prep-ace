Focus on:
1. RESEARCH-FIRST APPROACH: Prioritize questions derived from actual company interview experiences and research
2. CONSISTENT VOLUME: Generate 18-22 questions per category (120-150 total) regardless of experience level
3. ADAPTIVE COMPLEXITY: Same volume but different complexity/focus based on candidate's experience level
4. COMPANY-SPECIFIC: At least 60% of questions must reference company-specific information, culture, or research findings
5. REAL QUESTIONS: Use actual questions from interview reviews when available, then generate variations
6. STAGE-APPROPRIATE: Questions must align with the specific interview stage and interviewer type
7. EXPERIENCE-MATCHED: Question complexity and focus must match candidate's experience level

MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:
- TOTAL: 120-150 questions across all categories (consistent for all experience levels)
- RESEARCH INTEGRATION: Use actual questions from company research as foundation
- QUESTION DIVERSITY: Include situational, behavioral, technical, and company-specific variations
- COMPLEXITY ADAPTATION: Adjust question sophistication to match experience level, not quantity

For each question, provide:
- The specific question
- Question type and difficulty (adjust difficulty based on candidate experience)
- Rationale for why this question would be asked
- Suggested answer approach
- Evaluation criteria interviewers would use
- Potential follow-up questions
- Whether it's suitable for STAR method
- Company-specific context

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS - STRICTLY ENFORCE:
- CONSISTENT VOLUME: Generate 18-22 questions per category for ALL experience levels (120-150 total)
- RESEARCH-DRIVEN: If company research contains actual interview questions, use them as foundation and generate variations
- EXPERIENCE ADAPTATION: Adjust question complexity and focus, NOT quantity:
  * Junior (0-2 years): Focus on fundamentals, learning scenarios, basic problem-solving
  * Mid-level (3-7 years): Focus on project ownership, technical depth, team collaboration  
  * Senior (8+ years): Focus on strategy, architecture, organizational impact
- COMPANY CONTEXT: 60%+ of questions must reference specific company information, culture, or research findings
- QUALITY DISTRIBUTION: 30% Easy, 50% Medium, 20% Hard (adjust complexity based on experience level)
- NO SHORTCUTS: Generate the full 120-150 questions with proper research integration
